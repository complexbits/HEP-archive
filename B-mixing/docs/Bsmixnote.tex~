\section{The Math}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Monte Carlo Simulation}

\Bs\ events are generated using a toy Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each event, the proper lifetime $t_p$ of the \Bs\ is first selected from a perfect exponential distribution with a mean at $\tau = 1.5 \times 10^{-12}s$ This time is then added to a random time ``smearing'' value, selected from a Gaussian distribution centered at zero, with $\sigma = \sigma_t$.
This smearing is intended to represent the time-resolution limitations of the detector.  

\item The new, smeared time, is then smeared again with a second Gaussian centered at zero, but having a lifetime-dependent\footnote{We're in the rest frame of the \Bs} $\sigma = \sigma_nt_p$.  This second smearing is intended to account for unmeasured neutrinos in the decay of the \Bs, which carry away a proportionally larger amount of momentum for long-lifetime \Bs\ than for short-lifetime \Bs, regardless of the decay mode\footnote{This will soon be updated to use a distribution which takes decay mode, among other things, into account}, thus adding more error to the determination of the decay length of longer-lifetime \Bs.  The final, ``measured'' time, is then $t$.

\item Next, it is decided whether or not the \Bs\ in an event ``mixes'' by comparing a number selected from a flat random distribution between 0 and 2 with the value of $1+cos(\Delta m t_p)$ (the mixing comparison), where $\Delta m$ is the mass difference between the \Bs\ and \Bsbar.  If the first number is larger than the mixing comparison, the \Bs\ has mixed to a \Bsbar\, otherwise it remains ``unmixed''.  In either case, it is tagged accordingly.

\item Finally, the possibility of mistagging is considered, at a percentage rate\footnote{The dilution $D = 1-2\alpha$} $\alpha$.  This is the percentage of events for which a \Bs\ is actually supposed to be a \Bsbar\, or vice versa.  A number is selected from a flat random distribution between 0 and 1, and compared to $\alpha$ to determine whether the particle is mistagged, smaller numbers than $\alpha$ indicating that this is the case.  The tag of the particle is then adjusted accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
To run this simulation, the user must specify:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r@{\,\,\,}l@{\hspace{0.25in}}r@{\,\,\,}l@{\hspace{0.25in}}r@{\,\,\,}l@{\hspace{0.25in}}}
	
	{\tt tSigma}: & $\sigma$ for time-independent smearing & {\tt nEvts}: & The number of events & {\tt dm}: & $\Delta m$ \\	
	{\tt nSigma}: & $\sigma$ for time-dependent smearing & {\tt misTag}: & The mistag rate ($\alpha$) &{\tt tau}: & $\tau$  \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent The MC is also currently capable of generating a simple exponential background, with a user-definable signal-background ratio, but we have not used this functionality yet.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Fitting}

Each set of generated events is histogrammed by lifetime, depending on the tag, and fit with a function\footnote{ {\tt mll\_fit\_d()} in {\tt unbinFitosc\_d.cpp}, which refers to {\tt lftmosc\_plt\_d()} and {\tt mixing()} in {\tt func.cpp} } which takes the following as parameters: $\Delta m$, $\sigma_t$, $\tau$, {\tt tag}, $\alpha$, and $t$, where $t$ is the independent variable.  The actual fit function is:

\begin{equation}
	f = (1-2\alpha)\frac{e^B}{2\tau}\left[1+Erf(A)-\mbox{\tt tag}\cdot w_r^-e^{-A^2}\right] 
		+ \alpha\frac{e^B}{2\tau}\left[1+Erf(A)+\mbox{\tt tag}\cdot w_r^-e^{-A^2}\right]
\end{equation}

\[	 
	A=\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}\,\sigma}-\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}\,\tau}\,\,; \mbox{\hspace{0.5in}} 
	B=\frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}-\frac{t}{\tau}\,\,; \mbox{\hspace{0.5in}} 
	C=\frac{\sigma \Delta m}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

\noindent where $w_r^-$ is the real part of the complex error function $w(z)$ \cite{cwerf,roofit}, evaluated at $z = C - iA$. Note that as $A$ increases, the term $w_r^-e^{-A^2} \rightarrow cos(2AC)$.\\

\noindent The code used for fitting ({\tt unbinFitoscd.cpp}) utilizes Root's version of MINUIT\cite{minuit} to do an unbinned likelihood fit, meaning that generated values of the lifetime $t$ are compared to the distribution function $f$ individually (and therefore independent of any histogram binning), to determine the probability of selecting that value of $t$ from the distribution $f$.  MINUIT adjusts the fit parameter(s) in small steps, and runs the test against $f$ over again until the probability is maximized, and then returns the final value of the fit parameter(s) and the associated error.\\

\noindent By ``fixing'' all parameters but $\alpha$ during the fit, we have essentially fit for only the amplitude of the oscillation, hence the ``unbinned likelihood amplitude'' fitting.

\section{Calculating Sensitivity \label{calcsens}}

For each set of conditions tested, sensitivity to a measurement of dilution ($D = 1-2\alpha$) was calculated as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The process of generating events and fitting for the dilution was done 20+ times for each run, each time with $\Delta m=1000$ in the 
	MC, and $\Delta m$ in the fit fixed at a value varied between 0 and ~20 over the course of the run (or less when higher precision was required).
\item The {\em error} in $\alpha$, as reported by MINUIT, was plotted against $\Delta m$.
\item The equation of a straight line crossing through the dilution error value just below 1, and that just above 1, was determined.
\item The {\em Sensitivity} was then calculated to be the value of $\Delta m$ for which this line crossed 1.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In general, testing the sensitivity of a dilution measurement involved setting one or more parameters diffently in the MC than in the fit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

Sensitivity of a dilution measurement was tested under the following conditions:  Variations in $\sigma_t$, Variations in $D$, and variations in $\sigma_n$.  In the first two cases, the Condor batch scheduler was used to run the series of testes on the OUHEP cluster\cite{ouhep}, and in the last case, PBS was used to run the series of tests on OSCER\cite{oscer}.  Each sensitivity value represents a run of 20 generate-and-fit iterations, with $\Delta m$ varied between 0 and ~20 over the course of the run, as described in Section \ref{calcsens}.

\subsection{Variations in $\sigma_t$}

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{tabular}{|c||@{\hspace{1cm}}c@{\hspace{1cm}}|@{\hspace{1cm}}c@{\hspace{1cm}}|@{\hspace{1cm}}c@{\hspace{1cm}}|}
	\hline\hline
	Fit $\downarrow$ $\backslash$ MC $\rightarrow$ & 0.08 & 0.10 & 0.12 \\
	\hline\hline
	0.08 & 22.07 & 23.56 & - \\
	\hline
	0.10 & 17.66 & 17.74 & 17.88 \\
	\hline
	0.12 & - & 15.74 & 15.00 \\ 
	\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
}

The effect of $\pm$ 20\% variations in $\sigma_t$ on the sensitivity of $D$ are enumerated in Table \ref{Tts}.  Here, the dilution was set to 0.16 both in the MC and as an initial value in the fit. $\sigma_t$ was set to values of 0.1 $\pm$ 20\% in the MC, and for each of these, fitting was done with $\sigma_t$ values of 0.1 $\pm$ 20\%.  The combinations for which the listed sensitivity is ``-'' were not tested.
